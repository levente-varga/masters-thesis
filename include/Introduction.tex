\chapter{Introduction} \label{Chapter:Introduction}

In the second half of the twentieth century, often referred to as the dawn of the digital age or the prehistory of the computer game\cite{malliet2005history}, video games started to emerge as a new leading medium. The first video games, compared to today's blockbusters sometimes developed by multiple studios around the world, were usually made by a handful of people and featured very limited and basic gameplay elements and game mechanics. 


Later, the genre boundaries began to blur, while entirely new genres started to form. At the same time, the gaming industry has undergone a rapid evolution in both production size, quantity, and variety, and introduced new hybrid game genres through a process called genre blending\cite{arsenault2009} by combining the key concepts of already existing genres. This process has led to more and more commercial success, as genre-blended games usually stand out with their unique mix of game mechanics and more diverse gameplay that appeal to more players.



\section{Motivation}

Although numerous combinations already exist, there are still many unexplored possibilities that could lead to engaging and innovative games. By examining existing genre combinations and identifying gaps in the market, this research aims to propose new genre fusions that could offer unique gameplay experiences. The ultimate goal is to develop a game based on one of these novel combinations.

Due to the limited time available for the thesis, the development of a complete game is unlikely. Instead, the feasibility of the proposed genre blend will be demonstrated by a game prototype that will retain all the characteristics and core concepts of each chosen genre, with limited visual appeal and polish.
