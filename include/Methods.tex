\chapter{Methods} \label{Chapter:Methods}

This chapter describes the core problem the and how this research plans to find answers to it.



\section{Approach}

% Expand, write what papers to use to answer each question

\textbf{Part 1:} To find answers to RQ1, the thesis will begin with a short research and experimentation where genre combinations - that currently do not exist - will be explored and analyzed whether they could function well together or not. As a result of this part, a genre combination will be chosen with which the thesis can continue to its second part.

\textbf{Part 2:} To answer RQ2, the project will involve the design and iterative implementation of a game prototype that combines all of the chosen game genres from Part 1 and their corresponding elements and game design patterns. 

During the project, between the iterative cycles, the game prototype will be occasionally tested on small player groups to gain instant feedback that could help the development stay on track.

At the end of the project, game testing sessions will be conducted that will include presenting the game prototype to others and letting them play with it for a short time while being guided and supervised. At the end of each session, using a feedback form and verbal questions\cite{björk2015Interviews}, data will be collected that will show how the combined gameplay design patterns work together and what the players think of their experience. Additionally, the game will be internally evaluated using the extended version of the GameFlow model\cite{sweetser2017gameflow}.

Finally, a data analysis will be carried out on the feedback collected during the tests. This involves data collected from surveys, but also statistical data from the game itself that can be visualized using various methods\cite{björk2015DataVisualization}. 

Furthermore, during the thesis, regular meetings will be conducted with the project supervisor Natasha Mangan to discuss progress and deal with any problems at hand.



\section{Time plan}

The table below contains all the planned deadlines. These time periods are longer than the course schedule would suggest, as this is a 30-credit master's thesis project. However, to allow for more flexibility, the project is started earlier.

    \end{tabular}
\end{center}



\section{Ethical considerations}

Anonymous feedback data will be collected during playtests. All playtesters will be informed about this in advance. 

Participation in the playtests will be voluntary and the participants can opt out at any time if they do not want to continue the playtest.
